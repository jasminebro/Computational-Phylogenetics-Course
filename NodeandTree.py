Exercise 6 - Creating and Using Node and Tree Classes
@author: jembrown
Below is the beginning of a Node class definition and a simple example of how
to link nodes to form a tree. Use this as a springboard to start thinking about:
- What other attributes of a Node might we like to store?
- How do we define a Tree class? What attributes should it have?
- Can you write a function to print out a parenthetical tree string
(e.g., ((spA,spB),spC)) if the only argument passed to the function is a
root node? This will require recursion.
